•	The university has 5 faculties. However, for engineering, it is sufficient to design computer and chemical engineering departments. You can assume that other faculties consist of a single department.

•	There are 4 offices, 2 classrooms and 2 laboratories in each department.

•	Installing components other than basic network hardware will allow you to get higher grades, for example you can place a thermometer in the chemistry labs.

•	Your system doesn’t have to work properly since you have to configure many devices, however design the necessary elements (such as server room) as basic possible.
